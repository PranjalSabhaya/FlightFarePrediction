# Image Classification Using CNN

This repository contains an Image Classification project built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained to classify images into different categories using deep learning techniques.

## 📌 About the Project
Image classification is a core task in computer vision where an input image is assigned a label from a fixed set of categories. This project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline:

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Building a CNN model  
- Training and validation  
- Model evaluation  
- Prediction on new images  

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch if applicable)  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- OpenCV  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
